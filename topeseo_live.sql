This is because of the fact that <strong>PPC campaign services</strong> are one of the fastest ways to spread the word in front of the targeted group of potential customers. There are always 3 ingredients when setting up the new <strong>PPC campaign</strong> - the keywords, the ads, and the landing pages. <strong>PPC management services</strong> can help you out.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Step 1 - Create a Large List of Keywords</strong></div>\n\n<p>First of all, you would need to brainstorm. You would have to think about the obvious keywords that a consumer would be looking about. You would need to enter the keywords into the Google</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keyword Tool</strong> and create a list of related phrases. You would be able to create hundreds of them in a spreadsheet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Competitive research</strong> would add some more keywords to the list and you would have an idea about the keywords that need to be added to the list.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Step 2 - Look out for competitors</strong></div>\n\n<p>The next step is to look at the keywords that your competitors are <strong>advertising </strong>on. Many people do not even know about this feature. This is actually offered with paid subscriptions to keyword tools. If you have one or more of your competitors advertising on certain keywords for months, you could be bidding on those as well. What you are trying to do here is piggybacking off their efforts. Competitive research would add more keyword ideas to the list and give an idea about some keywords that might be especially worthwhile to test. You can do this with help from <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/hire/pay-per-click-management\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PPC services in India</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Step 3 - Rank By Relevance</strong></div>\n\n<p>Both of the earlier steps were more of a discovery process. Now it is time to narrow down the list. You should go through the list and rank them based on how relevant they are. Get help from a <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/hire/pay-per-click\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>pay per click advertising agency</strong></a> if things become confusing. You should think both about the positive and negative aspects when you are talking about relevance. You should consider if the keyword matches the product well when you are advertising or is there a chance that you could misinterpret the intent of the person? While going for relevance, you can create a separate column in the spreadsheet and give them grades.</p>\n\n<p>During this sorting process, you should also group the keywords into categories so that you can create ad groups in <strong>Google AdWords</strong> with the help of <strong>PPC management services</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of clients who look for creativity now. But when you are trying to establish yourself, keywords are more about relevance. Only an experienced and top-order <strong>PPC marketing company</strong> would infuse creative keywords in the mix. Keyword creativity helps to expand the market of a <strong>PPC advertising agency</strong>. Risks are not indulged at the beginning of the career. It is important to sell the products to people who are looking for what you have on offer.</p>\n\n<p>Keywords with a vague outreach should be removed from the mix. This would help you to create a rough guideline. <strong>Pay per click services</strong> are the best people for this job.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Step 4 - Narrowing Down the Keywords</strong></div>\n\n<p>The next step to narrow down the list of keywords is to create a smaller list of keywords. This list should be highly relevant and you should be confident that these would have a very high conversion rate. How many keywords should you be choosing initially? This would depend on keyword search volume, the cost per click and your budget. The <strong>Google Keyword Tool</strong> would give an estimate of the approximate <strong>CPC </strong>that can be used as a rough guideline.</p>\n\n<p>You would need to get at least 100 clicks per keyword to get a sense of whether it would make conversions or not. If you need to test 20 keywords, a click is about $1 and you need 100 clicks, the test budget should be around $2000.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Step 5 - Brainstorming the Negative Keywords</strong></div>\n\n<p>Before you turn the ads on, you would need to think of the keywords you do not want to pay for. If you are selling a high-end service product or keyword, you would not your ads to be shown when people are searching for keyword phrases like &#39;affordable&#39;, &#39;cheap&#39; or &#39;discount&#39;. If you are setting up a <strong>Google AdWords campaign</strong>, you should put them up as negative keywords. You do not want to blow the test budget on unqualified clicks. <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/best-pay_per_click_management-companies\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PPC management services</strong></a> are there to help you through this.</p>\n\n<p>These are some of the basic steps that you need to undertake for keyword research.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>What are the few points that need to be kept in mind?</strong></div>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Brainstorming the PPC Keyword List</strong></div>\n\n<p>The starting point of the keyword research should be the landing page. The keywords can be broadly categorized into a few types:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li><strong>Brand terms -</strong> a keyword that contains the trademarked terms or the brand name</li>\n	<li><strong>Generic terms -</strong> terms that relate to the products</li>\n	<li><strong>Related terms -</strong> terms that are not completely related to the product you are selling, but something that consumers might search for</li>\n	<li><strong>Competitor terms -</strong> the brand names of competitors that offer similar products and services</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You need to put yourself into the shoes of the customers and guess the queries what they might into the search box. You would need to figure out how you can bring the traffic to your website. You should consider specificity while selecting the keywords. Sometimes, it can benefit to include the broad term, but it might not always be very relevant. <strong>A dedicated PPC agency</strong> will be very good at this. A very specific, long-tail keyword phrase might get only a few searches per month. But they are less competitive and much less costly.</p>\n\n<p>A technique called &#39;<strong>concatenation</strong>&#39; can be used. It would expand keyword lists and merge columns of words together through online tools. You should also consider that people may misspell at times. However, you should be careful not to include the misspelled keywords in the ad group if you are using <strong>Dynamic Keyword Insertion</strong>. A separate ad group for misspellings should be present. Also, Google has improved a lot in the field of recognizing misspellings, making this step somewhat unnecessary.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Expanding and refining the Keyword List</strong></div>\n\n<p>You should use the <strong>keyword research tools</strong> that are available at your disposal to determine the keywords that you should keep and what you should drop. There are dozens of tools that can give an insight into the popular keywords. <strong>High-volume and low-competition keywords</strong> are the ones that you should be paying attention to. If the search volume is low or the competition is very high that the cost of bidding goes high, you should consider dropping the keywords from the list. Using the keyword list will help you to prune new keywords while discovering new terms that you have not considered before.

If the product being sold is straightforward, a good rule of thumb is to mimic the structure of the website. You would need to highlight your brand through this approach.</p>\n\n<p>You are definitely not going to discover every keyword in the first go. You would need to keep bidding, make regular updates and stick with something that offers the results.</p>\n','5cdb42f18b3cfimage.png','PPC Management Services',8,1,'2019-05-14',1),(18,'Amazon Product Listing With Amazon PPC - Top SEOs','Shifali','<h3>Learn About <strong>Best Practices</strong> For <strong>Amazon Product Listing</strong> With <strong>Amazon PPC</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Overall competition on <strong>Amazon listings</strong> has gone up by 8% last year. This shows how aggressive sellers are getting when it comes to hitting the top shelves of Amazon. This helps the products to perform better in the <strong>marketplace</strong>. The best sellers would research very often, scout for the different products efficiently, modify the markets and enhance the <strong>marketing tactics</strong>. This helps them to align the selling objectives and automate the business processes and increase profitability. <strong>Amazon PPC</strong> can play a very important role here.</p>\n\n<p>It is evident that Amazon continues to grow and make bigger opportunities for third-party sellers on the <strong>e-commerce pulse</strong>. The more the number of sellers, the higher is the competition. It is important to understand how each product listing can be created and optimized. This would drive more traffic and offer better conversions. It is important for the sellers to comprehend what the others are doing and know more about <strong>Amazon advertising</strong>. It would help the sellers to learn to acquire more visibility and identify the room for improvement and development, unveil practices, tricks and tools that the sellers are using for <strong>better performance</strong>.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Factors that are affected by the Amazon Algorithm</strong></div>\n\n<p><strong>The Amazon A9 algorithm</strong> is efficient and iterative search methodology that scans, reads and analyzes the data on the <strong>Amazon Marketplace</strong>. It is a form of artificial intelligence algorithm that determines the products that are ideal for the query of a customer. This helps to rank them with the most relevant top results. The ranking algorithms are designed to automatically combine different relevance features. The structured data in the catalog offers the necessary features that present the best results. <strong>Amazon PPC</strong> can help with things here.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>The text should match relevancy</strong></div>\n\n<p>Relevancy plays an important role. It is important to do a valuation and check the content of the product listing - the product title, features, and the description. The listings would be shown on the test results if the content matches the search terms or the keywords searched by the users. The <strong>better the relevance of the text, the higher the rankings</strong>. The factor would make it very important to prioritize the listing. The creative titles, engaging descriptions, and the keyword-rich content and clear bullet points would offer a rank on the top. <strong>PPC management services India</strong> can help in such cases.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Velocity of Sales</strong></div>\n\n<p>It is another crucial factor that is considered by the A9 algorithms that determine the product rankings. The number of seller transactions and the value of the sales taking place in a month defines this criterion. The <strong>seller&#39;s velocity</strong> would be compared to those of its competitors for the exact search terms. The seller with the <strong>highest sales velocity</strong> would go on top.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Availability of Stock</strong></div>\n\n<p>Many <strong>experts </strong>stress on the fact that sellers should keep their items in stock.

If you are a seller who is new to the world of <strong>Pay Per Click marketing</strong>, it is important to get accustomed to the <strong>Amazon advertising</strong>. You might ruin your budget if you do not have much idea about what you are doing. Let us get into a little more detail about <strong>Amazon PPC campaigns</strong>.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>What is Amazon PPC? How does the auction work?</strong></div>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon PPC</strong> is an established <strong>advertising platform</strong> that can help the sellers to amplify the products that they sell online. <strong>Pay-per-click or PPC advertising</strong> is a method where the advertiser pays for the ad if the potential buyer clicks the ad and views the product.</p>\n\n<p>If <strong>an Amazon PPC campaign</strong> is created, properly managed and executed, it can help improve the sales and even the organic rankings. <strong>PPC works</strong> quite differently from pay-per-mail advertising, which is an impressions-based method of advertising. In PPM, the advertiser needs to pay for every 1000 people who see the ad. <strong>The Amazon ads</strong> help the sellers to get or buy the top position on the <strong>Amazon rankings</strong>.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>When should you go for Amazon Pay Per Click?</strong></div>\n\n<p>It is advisable to go for <strong>Amazon Pay Per Click</strong> as soon as you have a listing. If you want to improve the effectiveness of the campaign, you can wait till the time that your listing has 3-5 reviews. You should start the <strong>Amazon Pay Per Click campaign</strong> as soon as the listing is live. This would help you to identify the right set of keywords and understand the competition of the keywords. This would help to understand the typical budget to run the <strong>PPC campaign services</strong>. On the basis of the information that you collect, you can even adjust the pricing to ensure selling profitability.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>How does the paid search in Amazon work?</strong></div>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Paid Search</strong> is not as complicated as it might sound. Amazon gets millions of searches every month. These include phrases that are short to long. Most of these people are looking to buy products from Amazon. The potential shoppers are not at Amazon for window shopping. They are not there to discover ideas, but to buy. Most people go to the search box and type the name of the product that they want to buy. <strong>PPC advertising companies</strong> can help you make a name for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon would offer the list the products that it feels would satisfy the requirements of the buyers. The results that are displayed in this space are termed as the organic results. However, there are some &quot;paid&quot; search results. These would be displayed above the organic results, no matter the search term. They can even appear in between the organic results on the right or below the organic results.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of the ad program from Amazon is simple. An enhanced auction-based approach is used where the sellers set their daily budgets for the ads. The higher the seller is ready to pay for the ad, the greater are the chances for the product to be displayed. Take help from a dedicated <strong>PPC marketing company</strong>. The vendors actually pay the advertisements per click, which means the amount would need to be paid every time a buyer clicks on the ad. According to reports, the model has been successful for most of the retail giants. The paid search revenue earned by Amazon in a year is in billions. Thus these ads have quite an impact.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>The type of Amazon PPC Ads</strong></div>\n\n<p>The <strong>PPC ads from Amazon</strong> can be classified into three types:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Sponsored product ads</li>\n	<li>Headline search ads</li>\n	<li>Product display ads</li>\n</ol>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Sponsored Product Ads</strong></div>\n\n<p>The <strong>Sponsored Product Ads</strong> allow the business to advertise the products depending on the keywords. When it comes to sales conversions and the <strong>click-through rates</strong>, these sponsored ads always perform very well. They are quite beneficial because they mix organic results and personalize the experience. They can be seen below the <strong>Amazon organic search results</strong>. They work very well if you have done the homework on keyword research.</p>\n\n<p>They can be typically seen on the organic search results of Amazon. They are present in the product detail page or on the right side of the search results. They work best if you have done proper homework on keyword research. <strong>PPC management services</strong> can help you get this done. To set up the Sponsored Products ad, you would just need to select the product, choose the keyword term and allocate the budget. Amazon would automatically target sponsored ads to suit the audience. It has been seen through research that businesses can actually have better sales with Amazon Sponsored Ads than Google Adwords. They are also cheaper than Google ads.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Headline Search Ads</strong></div>\n\n<p>Like the <strong>Sponsored Ads</strong>, the <strong>Headline Search Ad</strong> would be limited to particular product categories. These are those that appear on top of the search results, along with the brand logo. They are also known as <strong>banner ads</strong> that have the objective of getting the buyers to click from a certain group of products. They are placed on the top so that they increase the possibility of being seen. It is possible to display multiple products simultaneously with headline ads. The ad copy and the landing destinations can be modified as well. <strong>Amazon PPC</strong> offers a wonderful opportunity for each seller.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Product Display Ads</strong></div>\n\n<p><strong>The Product Display Ads</strong> is a type of <strong>PPC ad</strong> that is shown on a product page in the &#39;similar product&#39; section. You can create one with help from a <strong>PPC agency</strong>. These ads are designed as self-service options and are paired with the ASINs and give marketers a greater option to focus on the behavioral segments. Each type of ad would have a budget and screen placement section. Thus the <strong>click-through rate influence</strong> and <strong>conversion rate</strong> would vary differently. Amazon allows the sellers to match every deal with an intended audience for the <strong>Display Ad</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>You should take care to match the objectives with the kind of ad that you are choosing. The <strong>sponsored ads</strong> should be utilized to target the shoppers who have purchase intent, while the headline ads would serve better if the main aim is to create good brand awareness. The product display ads can serve both purposes. You can target the detail page of the product, related interests, related categories, and complimentary things. It is vital to comprehend three things - the type of product, target audience and objectives. Get in touch with a <strong>PPC company</strong> for better results.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>What are the factors that affect PPC placements?</strong></div>\n\n<p>If there is more than a single relevant product for a specific search term, there would be competition for the ad placement. Two vital factors would decide the ad placement.</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li><strong>Amazon CPC - </strong>The highest bid would win it. This is simply because the seller is willing to pay a higher CPC than the others.</li>\n	<li><strong>Quality Factor - </strong>The quality of the <strong>Amazon ad</strong> is measured by the possibility of the potential buyer to click on it. The ad click&#39;s history is taken into account in this case.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Higher the <strong>Amazon CPC</strong>, the greater are the chances of the ad being placed with the other advertisers of the same product. <strong>Ad quality</strong> would also be playing another key role. The higher the quality of the ad, the lesser you would need to bid for the ad to appear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PPC marketing</strong> has developed in the field of <strong>online marketing</strong>. The pages on the Internet are provided with advertising banners. <strong>Amazon PPC</strong> is offering a chance to the sellers to create a dynamic online market.</p>\n','5cdb498d4c0feimage.jpeg','Amazon PPC Campaigns',7,1,'2019-05-14',1),(20,'Create A PPC Funnel To Increase ROI - Top SEOs','Top-SEOs','<h3>Ways Used By <strong>PPC Marketing Firm</strong> To Create A <strong>PPC Funnel</strong> To <strong>Increase ROI</strong></h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Before you embark on your <strong>PPC campaign</strong> march to scale up your business know what you are getting from the <strong>PPC agency</strong> you hired.</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Is the practitioner of <strong>PPC </strong>just maintaining your account?

Usually when a budget is set the entire amount is not spent on a particular set of keywords. Different level of keywords is set and the spend is allotted to each of these. The CPA goals of each of them will vary. There may be budget influxes or reductions and based on this budget adjustment is made for certain <strong>CPA goals</strong>.

Many companies are preferring the services of freelancers today. What can be the reasons behind this tendency? What is making this trend more appealing today than in the past?&nbsp; Every company may have different reasons to <strong><a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com\">hire freelancers</a></strong>. Here are some of them that elicit this kind of action from the business fraternity.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>freelancers </strong>cannot much enjoy the stability of a monthly income that comes with availing the permanent employee status. Yet some of the risk this and opt for <strong>freelancing </strong>rather than work on a traditional job. This group had never been the first choice of the companies but in certain circumstances, the companies do prefer freelancers. What are these let us find out?</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Expertise And Special Skills</strong></div>\n\n<p>Usually, only a handful of people have some <strong>specialized skills</strong>. Most of such people are not comfortable with working in a routine set up every day that has to be followed in a 9-5 job. In such a job there may be little chance to always work only using their skills. They would have to do some other kinds of work that they are not comfortable with. Also, for them putting their skills to use is really important and other features like the stability of job and income are secondary.</p>\n\n<p>So, such people prefer working as freelancers. The companies also may need the use of such <strong>specialized skills</strong> only sometimes for certain projects. So, this kind of arrangement of hiring a freelancer who possesses these special skills works perfectly fine both ways.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Cost-Effective And Prudent</strong></div>\n\n<p>When the services of a <strong>special skilled person</strong> are required only for a limited number of projects it would be foolhardy to <strong>hire a skilled person</strong> on a permanent basis and pay a high monthly salary and perks to him or her. To cut costs the company may prefer to <strong>hire a freelancer</strong>. On the completion of the project both can part ways. The company saves so much by way of not hiring a permanent employee. Instead, paying a little extra to the freelancer may draw out the best from him or her and will serve the company better. The services of such freelancers may be available in the future with ease too. Losing out on the benefits a permanent employee enjoys may be a disadvantage for the freelancer but being his or her own master can be a motivator to work as a freelancer for such people.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>One-off Assignments</strong></div>\n\n<p>Most of the companies may take up <strong>project-based work</strong>. these are usually one-off assignments. Also, each different project may need a different skill set. <strong>Hiring an employee</strong> for one of a kind project on a permanent basis is an unwise step. Instead, different freelancers can be deployed for the works they are adept at. Then on completion pay them and each can go their separate ways. This will be cost-effective and most importantly the <strong>special talent</strong> is not wasted on unnecessary work too.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>No Waste of Talent </strong></div>\n\n<p><strong>Freelancers</strong> with special talents can put their <strong>skills</strong> to use only when they get a chance to do it. Binding them with other kinds of work the corporate world will lose so much. Once the company has completed a project under a freelancer, he or she is free to work for someone. The best of talents can be put to good use.</p>\n\n<p>These are just a few reasons why freelancers are preferred over a permanent employee.</p>\n','5d0a0fe09918fimage.jpeg','hiring-freelancers-is-a-better-option',8,1,'2019-06-19',1),(23,'5 Contemporary Google Algorithm Updates 2019 for SEO That You Must Know','saurabh shukla','<p>The Google Algorithm Updates 2019 have vital significance for <strong><a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/hire/digital-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\">digital marketing</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.top-seos.com/hire/digital-marketing/\"><strong> professionals</strong></a>.

However, from time to time we witness websites and blogs where we just get astonished, angry, and do not know how to react. There is still much uncertainty about <strong>SEO </strong>and its practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So today we are giving <strong>SEO awards</strong>. The awards consist of three categories, first the best, second-worst, and lastly the weirdest things we have seen on the internet so far regarding <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/best-local_seo-companies-in-canada\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SEO strategies</strong></a>. We will not declare anyone as the winner, you can assume it as a tie among all three nominations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>The Best Things We Have Seen</strong></div>\n\n<h2><strong>1. Link Building</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The day may come when links do not play a predominant role in <strong>higher rankings</strong>; the day has not arrived yet. Those people who are ignoring this ranking factor are harming their rank on the search engine. However, we have seen the right kinds of links, relevant links, and links that are earned. We consider <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/hire/link-building\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>link building</strong></a> as one of the <strong>best SEO practices</strong>, and every <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/hire/local-seo-experts\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>white hat SEO expert</strong></a> will get an agreement on this point.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>2. Mobile First</strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>Mobile optimization</strong> is here, and it is not the future anymore. Those who are not heeding the warning will soon pay the price. Google is currently doubling down on mobile and giving notices to those websites where content is not accessible appropriately to a user will not rank highly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However, we have seen many websites that are considering a <strong>mobile-friendly website</strong> or blog as their priority. These websites or blogs are higher in the ranking, and if they are not, then they will come soon on <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Google&rsquo;s top ranking</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><strong>3. User Experience (UX)</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Every website owner requires focussing on its <strong>UX</strong>. Google encourages webmasters to focus on those who are offering <strong>good user experience</strong>. The algorithm is getting smarter. People must understand that writing clean code is not enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>UX design</strong> should increase customer satisfaction and ease of use. Those who are providing a great user experience are naturally coming on <strong><a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com\" target=\"_blank\">top of the rankings</a>.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>The Worst Things We Have Seen</strong></div>\n\n<h2><strong>1. Paid Links</strong></h2>\n\n<p>A successful blog or website takes time and requires hard work and patience to create high content and earn those <strong>natural backlinks</strong>. Instead of hard work and persistence, we have witnessed people taking shortcuts. Some of them get success but it is temporary, and soon they will see massive failure.</p>\n\n<p>Buying any links is the worst practice, and sooner or later Google will find it out. Once Google finds it out, those websites and blogs will lose rankings, and they will need to try much harder to acquire something online.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>2. Duplicate Content</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The content should be original and unique. However, we have seen things like duplicate content on several sites. It is the worst practice from an <strong>SEO</strong> point of view. You should not index your page when you have nothing new to provide to your users, simple.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose for an excuse here, if you need to copy content from other sites because the material is helpful for readers or because of anything, then you should not index those pages. So, there will be no impact on <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/hire/search-engine-optimization\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong>,</a> but some of the <strong>SEO guys</strong> do not understand this so crucial thing.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>3. Ads Above The Fold</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Too much advertisement above the fold is a bad or worst <strong>SEO</strong>. Google penalizes those websites that place too many ads above the area of the web page that is appearing without any scrolling. These types of <strong>strategies </strong>affected by a decrease in traffic first.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>The Weirdest Things We Have Seen</strong></div>\n\n<h2><strong>1. Keyword Stuffing</strong></h2>\n\n<p>By keyword stuffing, we do not mean keyword stuffing on the content, which comes in the worst <strong>SEO </strong>case. We are talking about keyword stuffing on alt image tags. Isn&rsquo;t weird?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Most of the <strong>SEO </strong>guys think that no one sees alt image text, so it is fine to stuff keyword on it, right? Completely wrong!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It would not result in a penalty by Google probably, but it is not likely to do any <strong>good for on-page SEO</strong>. For visually-impaired visitors, it is highly frustrating and annoying.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>2. Doorway Pages</strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>SEO </strong>guys create these pages for a specific intention of ranking for a particular keyword to funnel readers and visitors to a different page. The issue with this weird <strong>SEO technique</strong> is that these pages provide little or no useful content. These useless pages often take all the <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>top rankings</strong></a> for a specific keyword.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>3. Invisible Text</strong></h2>\n\n<p>It might sound weird, but we are talking about bizarre <strong>SEO techniques</strong> that people use hidden text on their site. It was a practice in an early period of <strong>SEO</strong>, but it still happens. The purpose is to protect keywords by matching the text color with the color of the background or position the text off the screen by using CSS (it becomes visible for search engines only).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></div>\n\n<p>So, these were the <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/best-seach_engine_optimization-companies\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>best SEO technique</strong></a> done by <strong><a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/hire/local-seo-experts\" target=\"_blank\">white hat SEO experts</a></strong>, but there is more to improve as we saw in the worst and weirdest things. There are undoubtedly other <a href=\"https://www.top-seos.com/hire/search-engine-marketing\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SEO techniques</strong></a> that we did not cover because we wanted to include the top ones only as it is the <strong>SEO awards</strong>.

Today, there is high-speed internet that companies can use to share large volumes of data from a local network to external servers within no time. Technology today is mostly about cloud computing, a system that does not require machines or software attached to it. SaaS apps are software applications which are transmitted via the internet and are accessible from any point by any device. The SaaS companies stores the company&rsquo;s apps and, through the internet, distribute them to the final user.</p>\n\n<p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is a new and decent method of acquiring information. It is incomparable to the traditional way where one has to buy and load the software into a device. The customers can access the software from the internet through a 3rd &ndash;party service provider. There are three levels of cloud computing, namely; SaaS (Software as a Service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), and PaaS (Platform as a Service).</p>\n\n<p><strong>SaaS Users</strong></p>\n\n<p>SaaS applications are cloud-based and are sharable software whose creator is the one who stores and manages. SaaS applications are still gaining momentum in the market, and its primary users are in HRM, CRM, sales, procurement, and in communication. However, since it is not expensive, plenty of small and medium companies are some of its beneficiaries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SaaS Implementation</strong></p>\n\n<p>SaaS applications are transmittable via a web browser or a small client terminal. SaaS service subscribers pay either monthly or annually, and the prices depend on the usage capacity. These parameters may vary depending on the number of transactions or the number of users accessing it.</p>\n\n<p>The users can adjust the app settings and design them according to their specifications. However, enterprises who want to monitor their data and software totally, don&rsquo;t accept app code customization or main features.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Importance of SaaS to Customers</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pay Per Use</strong></p>\n\n<p>SaaS applications do not have license fee attachments, so they don&rsquo;t require an advance fee to purchase. Clients don&rsquo;t have to buy the entire product but can buy whatever product they need or pay within a particular period they will be using. Customers can stop subscriptions whenever they wish, and the risks are very minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Transform The IT Department</p>\n\n<p>SaaS can transform the way the IT department thinks and even relates to the other business departments.&nbsp; By implementing SaaS, the provider is the one who handles most of the operations. For instance, they are capable of day to day running of the application, trying out and installing patches, managing upgrades, tracking performance, ensuring accessibility, etc. The IT department can concentrate on valuable activities that are geared towards achieving the business&rsquo; objectives. The IT department can then perform better since they have all it takes and are now directly involved in contributing to the success of the company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Automated Updates</strong></p>\n\n<p>Licensed software that is installed in devices like computers needs regular updates. Outsourced cloud software has all the updates and automation installed by a SaaS company. All the work of installing and downloading patches is automated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accessible from Anywhere</strong></p>\n\n<p>Licensed software has limited accessibility. The license is only accessible to a specific number of devices and is not available from a different computer. With SaaS, you can obtain it from any device with an internet connection at all times. It does not restrict your movement, and you are free to work with the software.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Thoughts on SaaS</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>The clients can access it from the internet through a service provider who hosts it.</li>\n	<li>It is easy to install, cheap to set up, readily available apps, and is faster to distribute.</li>\n	<li>It is quite stable since the IT framework is broad and creative.</li>\n	<li>The organizations are shield off the expensive hardware and software maintenance.</li>\n	<li>Subscriptions on SaaS can either be monthly, annually, bi-annually, etc.</li>\n	<li>Damage assessments and improvements are the responsibility of the service providers.</li>\n	<li>Business applications like CRM, accounting, sales, etc. can outsource SaaS services.</li>\n	<li>Organizations with SaaS applications can customize their services according to their needs but only up to a certain level.</li>\n	<li>In case a business premise encounters disaster, the data remains intact since itis stored in the cloud.</li>\n	<li>Ideal for understaffed companies. They can bank on SaaS providers for updates and maintenance.</li>\n	<li>Clients can access the updates at the same time.</li>\n	<li>SaaS apps are compatible across many platforms, making it available from anywhere via the internet from any device.</li>\n	<li>It is highly scalable, so organizations can implement it as they expand.</li>\n	<li>Full control remains with the provider.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>With SaaS, it is easy to budget, and you can transpose the costs to opex (ongoing operation expense).</p>\n\n<p>SaaS software can handle multiple tasks, including accounting, invoicing, sakes, planning, and quoting. It is a good option for businesses as they can utilize a single software that discharges all the tasks.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone can be a user of the software by using a particular piece on installation. The users can either be one, two, or all the employees in a big organization.</p>\n\n<p>The future of cloud computing, especially SaaS, looks bright. If adequately implemented, businesses can achieve tremendous revenues and grow substantially, meeting all their needs without having to worry about technical issues or IT expenses.</p>\n','5ef5c6aecedb4image.jpeg','Understanding SaaS',12,1,'2020-06-26',1),(37,'How Business Process Automation Helps Companies To Survive COVID-19','Vinod Mahajan','<p>Since last December, the world is facing a massive crisis which is becoming bigger day by day.
